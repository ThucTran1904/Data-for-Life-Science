# Random Forest Model to predict whether users have heart disease or not
## Introduction

### To come up with the decision the model have to collect this data:
+ Age: The person's age in years
+ Sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
+ CP: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
+ trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
+ Chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
+ Fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
+ Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
+ MaxHR: The person's maximum heart rate achieved
+ Exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
+ Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot)
+ Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)
+ ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
+ thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
